/**
 * TestHarness
 * <p/>
 * Using CountDownLatch for starting and stopping threads in timing tests
 *
 *  TestHarness creates a number of threads that run a given task concurrently.
 * It uses two latches, a "starting gate" and an "ending gate". The starting gate
 * is initialized with a count of one; the ending gate is initialized with a count
 * equal to the number of worker threads. The first thing each worker thread does is
 * wait on the starting gate; this ensures that none of them starts working until they
 * all are ready to start. The last thing each does is count down on the ending gate;
 * this allows the master thread to wait efficiently until the last of the worker threads
 * has finished, so it can calculate the elapsed time.
